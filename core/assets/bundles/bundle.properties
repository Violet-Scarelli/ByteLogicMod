// Blocks

block.byte-logic-mod-signal-timer.name = Signal Delayer
block.byte-logic-mod-signal-timer.description = Passes a receiving signal after a certain number of ticks. The maximum allowed delay is 60 ticks, or one second.

block.byte-logic-mod-signal-switch-block.name = Switch Block
block.byte-logic-mod-signal-switch-block.description = A button that the player can toggle. Outputs a constant signal equal to 0 or 1.

block.byte-logic-mod-signal-block.name = Signal Block
block.byte-logic-mod-signal-block.description = Outputs a constant signal, the value of which can be adjusted.

block.byte-logic-mod-signal-node.name = Signal Node
block.byte-logic-mod-signal-node.description = Sends a signal to another node.

block.byte-logic-mod-signal-router.name = Signal Router
block.byte-logic-mod-signal-router.description = Receives a signal and sends it in 3 different directions.

block.byte-logic-mod-analyzer.name = Analyzer
block.byte-logic-mod-analyzer.description = Reads block information (number of items, liquids, energy, etc.) and converts it into a signal.

block.byte-logic-mod-controller.name = Controller
block.byte-logic-mod-controller.description = Turns the block in front of it on and off depending on the input signal.

block.byte-logic-mod-relay.name = Relay
block.byte-logic-mod-relay.description = Transmits a signal to other relay blocks.

block.byte-logic-mod-not-gate.name = NOT Gate
block.byte-logic-mod-not-gate.description = Logical operation "NOT". Inverts the inputted signal. Allows changing the direction of the receiving end.

block.byte-logic-mod-and-gate.name = AND Gate
block.byte-logic-mod-and-gate.description = Logical operation "AND" (Logical multiplication). Gives 1 if both inputs are 1. Allows changing the direction of both receiving ends.

block.byte-logic-mod-or-gate.name = OR Gate
block.byte-logic-mod-or-gate.description = Logical operation "OR" (Logical addition). Gives 1 if at least one of the input signals is 1. Allows changing the direction of both receiving ends.

block.byte-logic-mod-xor-gate.name = XOR Gate
block.byte-logic-mod-xor-gate.description = Logical operation "EXCLUSIVE OR". Gives 1 if the input signals are different. Allows changing the direction of both receiving ends.

block.byte-logic-mod-adder.name = Signal Adder
block.byte-logic-mod-adder.description = Adds the values of 2 inputted signals together. Allows changing the direction of both receiving ends.

block.byte-logic-mod-subtractor.name = Signal Subtractor
block.byte-logic-mod-subtractor.description = Subtracts the value of one input signal from another. Allows flipping the minuend and the subtrahend and changing the direction of both receiving ends.

block.byte-logic-mod-divider.name = Signal Divider
block.byte-logic-mod-divider.description = Divides the value of one input signal by another. Allows flipping the divisor and the dividend and changing the direction of both receiving ends.

block.byte-logic-mod-remainder.description = Gives the remainder of dividing the value of one input signal by another. Changes by clicking on the block.

block.byte-logic-mod-multiplier.name = Signal Multiplier
block.byte-logic-mod-multiplier.description = Multiplies the values of incoming signals. Allows changing the direction of both receiving ends.

block.byte-logic-mod-equalizer.name = Signal Equalizer
block.byte-logic-mod-equalizer.description = Checks for equality of the values of incoming signals. Allows changing the direction of both receiving ends.

block.byte-logic-mod-comparator.name = Signal Comparator
block.byte-logic-mod-comparator.description = Tests whether the value of one input signal is greater or less than another. Changes by clicking on the block. Allows changing the direction of both receiving ends.

block.byte-logic-mod-font-signal.name = Font Signal
block.byte-logic-mod-font-signal.description = Outputs a certain amount of signal power based off the input signal power. Dumping the output signal to a display will show either a number or a letter. Allows changing the direction of the receiving end.

block.byte-logic-mod-display.name = Display Block
block.byte-logic-mod-display.description = A 5x5 display. Can be controlled by regular signals or font signals. In the case of control by a normal signal, displays the pixels as the value of the signal would look in binary code.
